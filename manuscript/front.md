# About this booklet

This booklet contains chapter notes, hints, answers to exercises, addenda, and errata for the book [*Functional Programming in Scala*](http://manning.com/bjarnason) by Paul Chiusano and RÃºnar Bjarnason. There is no original material here, except for this brief introduction. This booklet is just a collection of material that is [freely available online](http://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala).

## Why make this?

*Functional Programming in Scala* is a book that relies heavily on exercises. This can make it difficult to consume by *reading* rather than doing. Since the exercise answers, hints, and chapter notes are all online, a number of people have expressed difficulty studying the book on a train, on flights, in a classroom setting, or generally where there is no internet connection or where it's inconvenient to use a laptop. So what I've done is literally print all of that material in a single document, as a companion for the book itself. Its purpose is to be convenient to use as a hardcopy, with an eBook reader, a tablet, or a phone.
