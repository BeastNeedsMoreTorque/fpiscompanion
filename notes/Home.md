# Chapter notes #

Chapter notes provide historical context, links to further reading, and additional discussion or connections to help tie the material we've covered in the book to the larger practice and research of the FP community. If you're interested, we encourage you to do some Wikipedia surfing and further exploration using some of the content covered here as a branching-off point.

Many of the chapter notes link to resources that use the [Haskell language](http://www.haskell.org). We recommend reading the [brief introduction to Haskell](A-brief-introduction-to-Haskell,-and-why-it-matters), which gives an overview of Haskell for Scala programmers.

A more up-to-date version of this content is available on [the FPiS community Wiki.][1]

## Getting answers to your questions ##

If you have any questions about the book, or about functional programming in Scala (or in general), here are some suggestions:

  * Ask on the [scala-functional mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scala-functional)
  * Talk to [Paul](http://twitter.com/pchiusano) and [RÃºnar](http://twitter.com/runarorama) directly on Twitter.
  * For questions regarding functional programming with the Scalaz library, ask on the [Scalaz mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scalaz).
  * Post your question on [the FPiS community Wiki.][1]
